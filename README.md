typescript-exercises

I thought the exercises were a good way to see Typescript in action.
It was good practice for me to use the terminal on each exercise as well.
Exercise 5 was a little challenging for me at first just because I got hung up on trying to correct the errors and forgetting that the web page was pulling from the JS file and not the TS file. 
I attended coaching hours with Joe and he explained everything well. After that, it made perfect sense.
